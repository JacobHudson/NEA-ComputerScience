# AI locomotion

*Teaching a bipedal AI to walk using inverse kinimatics along a unpredictable, procedural terrain.*

By Jacob Hudson

## Terrain Generation
### Idea
Create a small, low-poly area of land suitable for exploration by a humanoid character.
### Algorithms
[Marching cubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marching_cubes)

## Artificial Intelligence
### Idea
Generational learning using a points system to determine its level of success
### Algorithms

## Inverse Kinematics
### Idea
### Algorithms
[Unity built in IK](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/InverseKinematics.html#:~:text=This%20can%20be%20useful%20when%20you%20want%20a,any%20humanoid%20character%20with%20a%20correctly%20configured%20Avatar.)
